# INSTALLING PYTHON
I highly recommend the use of Anaconda or Miniconda. 
* If space isn't an issue and you're not sure what packages you'll be using, install Anaconda.
* If you have limited space (ie: you're installing on the NOCS Linux system or Jasmin computer), install Miniconda.

For a quick and easy list of Conda commands, see their "cheat sheet": https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf

## USING PYTHON - ENVIRONMENTS
When you install through any of the Conda versions, it sets up a "base" environment. It's best to leave that as it is, and work from another environment.

Using a new environment for each use of Python means you can avoid package version conflicts when you are using packages with different dependancies.
 
You can also swap Python version number for each environment. 

Details for setting up environments can be found on the cheat sheet. 

## USING PYTHON - CREATING SCRIPTS
There are 2 main ways of creating Python script files: use Spyder or Jupyter. These are 2 Python-based script editors.

Spyder is a bit like a Matlab environment whereas Jupyter runs on a web browser and is good for fully-formatted/annotated code with inline graphs/plot outputs displayed

## VERSION CONTROL
See the installation and help files. Git is the standalone desktop version, GitHub is a cloud-based repository of code.
