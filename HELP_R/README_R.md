# HELP_R directory

This folder hosts files that people either need help with or are sharing as tips of how to use R packages etc.

For those starting out with statistical analysis using R/RStudio, there is a useful UG module provided at the uni:

**BIOL6052 Data Management and Generalised Linear Modelling for Biologists**
https://www.southampton.ac.uk/courses/modules/biol6052.page

The module has a Blackboard site, and you can register for "guest" access by contacting the coordinator *(recommended by Flo Atherden and Sam Hallam)*.
