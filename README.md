# Welcome to the NOCS_coding!

This repository is for all NOCS and/or SOES Postgraduate students who want to share coding tips or get help with Python, Matlab and R scripts. 

The "Wiki" section will be a permanent base of key tips in the future. 
For general questions, please refer back to the Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/2679803138757799/

## Submission guidelines
### IMPORTANT: First things first...
If you haven't already, you're going to need to set yourself up a GitHub account. These are now completely free for private or educational use. To be able to post to this GitHub repository, please send your GitHub username to me via Facebook, email or face-to-face and I shall add you as a collaborator. This will then allow you to upload to this repository and raise issues. You must be a PG student at NOCS (NOCS-registered students based at Highfield are of course welcome too!) to post to this repository, although non-students who wish to help out should contact me and arrange to be added as a collaborator.

### "I need help with some code I've written"
Please upload a snippet of your code to the relevant folder (Matlab, Pythob, R), then raise an 'issue'. In the issue, please describe the problem in as much detail as possible, and quote the filename of the code you've uploaded. Remember to include enough info so that someone in this group can help you. Please tag the issue as `help wanted`, and if applicable, `bug`.

### "How do I..."
For general queries (without example code), raise an issue and tag is as `question` 

### "Solved" issues
Issues that have been raised and considered fixed should then be marked as "closed" rather than deleted altogether. This then provides a permanent record of questions, bugs and fixes. 

## To contact the admins:
Send us a message via GitHub or Facebook:
* GitHub repository admin: Matt Clark aka "ocean-matt". Prefer face-to-face? Come find me in office NOCS/256/28.
* Facebook group admin: Sara Lise

## Final point
If you think you have an even better way of sharing code and tips with fellow PGR students at NOCS, do let us know! We are very open to suggestions to make this work in the most efficient way possible.
